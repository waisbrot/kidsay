"Our whole house is a <i>dragon</i>. And it is dead. I'm collecting dragon bones."

Ezra pantomimes pulling down several rib bones and stacking them.&nbsp;

"Here is a book. It is <i>made</i> of dragon bones. Do you want to read it? It is <i>all about</i> dragons!"

(Looking through an actual book about dragons) "This dragon is <i>alive</i>. And this dragon is dead. This is the dragon that our house is in!"
