I roll a marble along the floor and it bumps Phineas' foot:

Phineas: "Hey! You hurt my foot!"

Me: "Oh no! Are you bleeding?"

Phineas: "Hey! You hurt my foot!" He punches me lightly on the shoulder.

Me: "No. We don't do that."

Phineas: "You hurt my foot."

Me: "OK. I'm sorry I hurt your foot."

Phineas: "No _I_ sorry." He sits on my lap, "you give my foot a kiss?"
