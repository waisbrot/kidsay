Phineas and Ezra are playing Minecraft. They have created hundreds of cats, who are all meowing.

Me: "Mow. Mrow!"

No reaction from Phienas.

Me: "Phineas, are you paying attention to my meowing?"<br/>
Phineas: "What?"<br/>
Me: "I asked if you were paying attention to my meowing."<br/>
Phineas: "Uhhhh... What?"<br/>
Ezra: "HE SAID 'ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION TO MY MEOWING'."<br/>
Phineas (to himself): "One emerald..."<br/>
Phineas: "Oh. Yeah, I was paying attention."
