_Background: Ezra fell and scraped his knee. Both boys went to a magic show where Ezra was up on stage and was given a trick wand. Phineas fell and scraped his knee (barely)._

Phineas: "Hi, Gus!" (our neighbor)<br/>
Gus: "Hi! How'd you like the magic show? Ezra, you were the star of it, right? When he gave you that wand?"<br/>
Ezra (excited): "Uh huh. He didn't _know_ that the wand was _made_ to break like that! And it _kept breaking_!"<br/>
Gus: "I know! I kept thinking it wasn't going to break and then it did."<br/>
Phineas (cheerful): "Yeah! And now my _leg_ is broken!"
