Phin is home from school. I asked if he saw anything on the way home.

"Yes. A bee! It wasn't flying around and it wasn't on a flower, so I picked
it up and put it on a flower. Well, first I pet it. I gave it some bee-pets. 
And I saw an ant and a dog. I got to pet the dog. And I threw a ball for it. 
_Unlike_ Sophie, it didn't just run away with the ball."
