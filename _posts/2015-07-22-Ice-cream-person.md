"I cooked the body to make the body very hot, and then I shoved a brain in her, and then I put a net over her as a cloth, and then I put a cup on her head to use as a hat. And then I had an ice-cream person, and then she turned off the stove and ran over to me. I found her leg-shadows right on the floor, over there."
