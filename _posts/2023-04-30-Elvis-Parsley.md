_Phineas has donned the persona "Elvis Parsley"_

Phineas: ... and all my fans have to pay me bribes ...<br/>
Ezra: If you try to make your fans _pay_ you then you won't have any _fans_.<br/>
Phineas: Yes I will! I'll _sue_ them!<br/>
Ezra: Why would they be your fans if you _sue_ them?<br/>
Phineas: Because they'll think that if they're my fans, I won't _sue_ them again. But then I _will_ sue them again!
