The kids are trying to decide who will get a particular cup. (Ezra already has the cup, but Phineas _really_ wants it and Ezra is indulging him.)

Ezra: "How about if we do Rock-Paper-Scissors-Shoot for it?"<br/>
Phineas: "Yeah!"<br/>
Both, in unison: "Rock-paper-scissors-shoot, any-thing-you-wanna-do..."<br/>
At the same time: (Ezra) "Invisibility!" (Phineas) "Shield!"

They realize that neither of them has won.

Ezra: "OK, let's try that again."<br/>
In unison: "Rock-paper-scissors-shoot, any-thing-you-wanna-do..."<br/>
At the same time: (Ezra) "Invisibiliy!" (Phineas) "Shield!"
