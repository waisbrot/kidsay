Phineas finds a new package of my socks: "Nate, why you not wearing your socks?"<br/>
Me: "I just didn't put any on. Should I put them on?"<br/>
Phineas: "Yeah."<br/>
Me: "Can you help me put them on?"<br/>
Phineas: "Okay."<br/>

Phineas starts to open the package, then stops. "We need the compass. Where the compass, Nate?"

We search all over the house and eventually find the compass.

"The compass says 'we need the pocket knife!'" Phineas follows the compass to Ezra's pocket knife and brings it over to me. "You use the pocket knife. Open here and here and here and here."

I open the sock package and Phineas directs me to put on a pair of socks.

"So, the compass... we don't need the pocket knife now." Phineas puts Ezra's knife away. "And, the compass say, 'put away the socks!'" Phineas puts away the remaining socks.
