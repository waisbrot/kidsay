Phineas comes out of the bedroom where he's supposed to be napping.

Carrie: "Yes?"<br/>
Phineas: "Carrie, I feel happy!"<br/>
Carrie: "I'm glad you feel happy. You still need to take a nap."<br/>
Phineas: "Carrie, I no need to take a nap. I need to wake up."<br/>
Carrie: "No, you need to take a nap."<br/>
Phineas: "No I need wake up!"
