Ezra got a "Star Wars" lego toy at a party and it's Darth Vader's sleep chamber or something. Ezra and Phineas have a lot of questions about Darth Vader, who Phineas calls "Dark Vader" and the Death Star, which they pronounce "Deaf Star".

Ezra: "Why is it called the Deaf Star? Do you look at it and _die_?"<br/>
Carrie: "It shoots a really big laser to blow up planets."<br/>
Ezra: "How is _that_ helpful?"<br/>
