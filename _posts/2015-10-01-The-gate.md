"Sorry! It's closed! I can't pay any money for you if it's closed! Come back at 20:30, with no trains!

"Phineas doesn't understand how the gate works. He has to pay quarters to go through but he didn't go through so they gave the quarters back but it's not supposed to work that way.

"You paid, so I will open the gate! Go through. You want to go to the special money bank? Phineas, you want to go to the special money bank? You want to go to the special money bank? Then hop on, and have a ride! OK, but it's closed! It's all closing! Everything's closed! The park's closed and the baby's closed too! The baby's closed and Stop &amp; Shop is closed! And you will not be compensated for any damages!"
