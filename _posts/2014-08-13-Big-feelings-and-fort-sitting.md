Ezra: "I want to sit on it."

Carrie: "You can't sit on it. It will fall apart and you'll fall down."

"I <em>want</em> to sit on it." (On the verge of tears)

"Forts aren't for sitting on. You could sit <em>in</em> the fort. You could sit on the hammock."

"But I really want to sit on the fort." (Begins to cry)

"It's not made for sitting, it's too fragile." (the tears aren't stopping) "Is the fort too upsetting?"

"I don't like the fort!"

"OK, we'll take to fort apart."

"<em>NOOOOOO!</em> I <em>like</em> the fort. I <em>really, really</em> like the fort!"
