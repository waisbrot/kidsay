Ezra: "This dinosaur does lots of helpful things. It feeds you healthy food, like good <em>pan</em>cakes with butter and toast. It will also help you get dressed!"

Carrie: "Well, I'm already dressed..."

Ezra: "It will also help you get <em>pajamas</em> on! And it will help you read a bedtime story to Phineas."

(Carrie sneezes)

Ezra: "And it will help you cover your mouth when you <em>sneeze</em>. And it has an excellent sense of smell so it can help you <em>find</em> things by smelling for them. And it has sticky feet so it can <em>stick</em> to places."
