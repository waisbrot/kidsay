"This mouse was made in <em>half</em>. (Points to the seam line in the plastic.) "See this line? That means they made it in <em>half</em>. If they made it in <em>whole</em> then it would be hard to put <em>batteries</em> in it, but since it's made it <em>half</em> you can put batteries <em>inside</em>.

"And why would you not want to put <em>batteries</em> in something!?"
