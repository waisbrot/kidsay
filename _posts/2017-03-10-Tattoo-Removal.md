_Ezra's Special Start teacher, Elizabeth related this to me. She had gotten a tattoo and the kids asked if it was temporary; she said it was permanent._

Ezra: Will it be on you until you _die_?

Elizabeth: Yes

Ezra: But when people _die_ they turn into _dirt_, so _I_ think that then your tattoo won't be _on you_. So it's not _permanent_.
