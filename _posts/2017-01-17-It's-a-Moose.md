The other day Carrie and Ezra were talking about how big a moose is (because Ezra got a lego moose). Carrie suggested that a moose would not fit (or only barely fit) in our bathroom.

Ezra is brushing his teeth before bed.

Ezra: "A mouse would not even fit in this bathroom!"<br/>
Me: "I think you mean a moose"<br/>
E: "The _only_ thing that can fit in this room is a moose!"<br/>
N: "Well that must mean that you are a moose, since you're in here."<br/>
E: "And _you're_ a moose _too_, since _you're_ in here!"<br/>
N: "That's right!"<br/>
E: "And everything else in here is _also_ a moose."<br/>
