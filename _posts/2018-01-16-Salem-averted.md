Phineas (playful): "Aaaah! A ghost!"<br/>
Carrie: "Oh! Are there ghosts in this house?"<br/>
Phineas: "Yeah!"<br/>
Carrie: "Are they friendly ghosts?"<br/>
Phineas (devilish): "No, they _bad_ ghosts!"<br/>
Carrie: "Oh, should we call the Ghostbusters? And get rid of them?"<br/>
Phineas (worried): "No, they just pretending to be ghosts."
