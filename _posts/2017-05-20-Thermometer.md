There is a thermometer on our back porch which is a large round dial with a thick needle, so it looks similar to an analog clock. Both kids have a hard time believing that it is _not_ a clock.

Phineas: (pointing at the thermometer) "Nate, why that not a clock?"<br/>
Me: "Well, 'clock' and 'thermometer' are words that describe what a thing _does_. This measures temperature, and so we call it a thermometer."<br/>
Phineas: "Why <unintelligible> 'momer?"<br/>
Me: "Are you asking something about the thermometer?"<br/>
Phineas: "<unintelligible>mer?"<br/>
Me: (slowly and clearly) "ther-mah-meeter"<br/>
Phineas: (slowly and clearly) "Fin-ee-us"<br/>
