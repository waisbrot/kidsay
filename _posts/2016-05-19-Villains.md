I'm reading "Baron Von Baddie and the Ice Ray Incident" to Ezra. We get to the page where the Baron is in jail,
looking out through a barred window.

Ezra: "Why are there _bars_ on the window?"<br/>
Me: "Because it's a jail, and the bars are there to keep him from escaping."<br/>
Ezra: "But he _does_ escape. Why don't they know that he digs a hole to escape?"<br/>
Me: "I don't know. Maybe it's not a very good jail?"<br/>
Ezra: "If Barron Von Baddie was smaller and he turned _sideways_, then he could get out through these two bars."<br/>
Me: "Often, a person's head is the most difficult thing to fit through a small space. If your head can fit through, you can usually fit the rest of you"<br/>
Ezra: "Yeah. And _babies_ have really small heads, so _baby_ villains could escape from jail _really easily_."
