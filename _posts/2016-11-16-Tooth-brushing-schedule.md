We are arguing over whether or not Ezra will brush his teeth himself. He wants me to do it for him.

Ezra: "You brush my teeth this time, and then *I'll* do it next time. You only have to brush my teeth
*two more times* -- this time, and right before you die. I'll brush my teeth all the other times."
