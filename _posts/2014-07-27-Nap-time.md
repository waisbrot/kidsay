Ezra is trying to fall asleep. I am on the porch in the hammock with Phineas, who has fallen asleep. The baby monitor is next to me. Some opera from Ezra's iPad is playing through with crackles and pops like an old-time radio. Intermixed with the opera is the sound of Ezra alternately groaning and shouting numbers. It is not a very relaxing station to listen to.
