Ezra: "Read this." (handing Phineas a sign he's written)<br/>
Phineas: "What does it say?"<br/>
Ezra: "It says 'eat poop'."<br/>
Phineas: "No, it says 'et poop'. The 'a' makes an 'eh' sound: 'eh... eh'."<br/>
Ezra: "No, it's a rule-breaker."<br/>
Ezra: "'When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking'"<br/>
Phineas: "Oh yeah. OK!"

(The sign did indeed read "eat poop", correctly spelled.)
