I describe a bit of the song "I am the Captain of the Pinafore" to Ezra.

N: "...and the ship that he's the captain of is called the Pinafore."<br/>
E: "Ships don't have names!"<br/>
N: "They do. Almost all ships have names."<br/>
E: "Is there a ship named Ezra?"<br/>
N: "Well, I don't know one but there are many, many ships and they all have names, so I'm sure some of them are named Ezra."<br/>
E: "How big are the ships?"<br/>
N: "Ships can be lots of different sizes. Some are giant, some are only big enough for one person."<br/>
E: "Do the people on the ships name them? Do they like the ships?"<br/>
N: "Yes, I hope so, since they're on them."<br/>
E: "Are there ships in your _mouth_?"<br/>
N: "No, there are not."<br/>
E: "I think there are!"<br/>
N: "Can you _see_ any in my mouth?" (Opening my mouth)<br/>
E: "Yes. I see five ships in your mouth."<br/>
N: "Oh yeah? What are the ships in my mouth named?"<br/>
E: "They are all named Ezra!"
