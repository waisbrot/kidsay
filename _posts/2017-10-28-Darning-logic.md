Ezra: "When are you going to darn these socks?"<br/>
Carrie: "I don't know."<br/>
Ezra: "Are you going to do it today?"<br/>
Carrie: "No."<br/>
Ezra: "What about tomorrow?"<br/>
Carrie: "No."<br/>
Ezra: "Then when?"<br/>
Carrie: "I don't know, Ezra. I have more important things to do than darning socks."<br/>
Ezra: "Like what?"<br/>
Carrie: "I don't know. Like everything. Darning socks is the _least important_ thing I have to do."<br/>
Ezra: "Does that mean that everything is more important than darning socks?"<br/>
Carrie: "Yes."<br/>
Ezra: "Does that mean that darning socks is more important than darning socks?"<br/>
