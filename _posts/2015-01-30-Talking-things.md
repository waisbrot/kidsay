Ezra enters the room carrying a snow shovel and ice scraper. "These things are trouble makers because they were bumping into things. They say, 'let us go! Let us knock over things! Let us fall on the baby!'"

"Hmm. This sounds like I should take them away from you."

Ezra talks to the shovel and scraper: "Stay there. Don't fall over."

(Later, they fell over onto things repeatedly and were taken away.)
