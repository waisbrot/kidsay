Ezra makes himself sun-butter and honey sandwiches for school lunch. Today he spotted the pomegranite and asked for some as part of lunch.
He likes broccoli with dinner and _loves_ rice. Breakfast is usually yogurt and cereal (cherios or grape nuts). He does not like baked pasta
(particularly my version of maccaroni and cheese). When we order food, Ezra always wants Indian so that he can get mango lassi.

Phineas likes the school's Friday pizza. Other days he packs himself something with protean, like chicken nuggets. He does not like broccoli.
He loves tacos, which is pretty much any protien in a tortilla shell. He usually skips breakfast because he's not hungry when he wakes up.
He still enjoys fish skin (medium-crispy). When we order food, Phineas likes Chinese so he can gorge himself on scallion pancakes.

Both kids like artichoke, fish, pasta with meat sauce, steak, vinegary chicken, tacos/burritos, sushi, and are willing to try nearly anything.
