Phineas is trying to corral Mooshrooms in Minecraft and getting increasingly frustrated by not being able to. He hits one of the mooshrooms in the game.

Ezra: "Don't hit the mooshrooms."<br/>
Phineas continues to be frustrated and does it again.<br/>
Ezra: "Stop. Hitting. The mooshrooms."<br/>
Phineas (near tears): "Stop! Being! Annoyed! It doesn't help!"<br/>
Ezra (very reasonable): "I think not hitting them would help a _little_."<br/>
