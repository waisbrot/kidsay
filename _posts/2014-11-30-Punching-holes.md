While driving in the car, Ezra says, "Phineas could make a hole in the door and then put his hand out and then grab a bird and then he puts the bird in his mouth and then heÂ <em>eats it!"</em>

Carrie: "I guess that could happen, but I don't want my baby to punch a hole in the car door."

Ezra: "I want to punch a hole in the car door."
