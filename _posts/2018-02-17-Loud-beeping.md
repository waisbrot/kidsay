Ezra: "BEEEEEEP! BEEEEEP! BEEEEP!"<br/>
Ezra: "I make loud no beeping whenever you say something!"<br/>
Carrie (to me): "I love him, but..."<br/>
Ezra: "DID YOU SAY YOU LOVE MY BUTT?"<br/>
Carrie (sarcastically): "Yeah, that's what I said."<br/>
Ezra: "HA HA! Phineas, she said she loves my butt!"<br/>
Phineas: "Ewwww, butt!"
