Phineas: Can you turn the living room light on?<br/>
Carrie: Why?<br/>
Phineas: Because I want them on. That's why.<br/>
Carrie: Fine. They're on.<br/>
Phineas: Why did you turn the night-light on?! I didn't ask for that!<br/>
Carrie: I didn't.<br/>
Phineas: Yes you did. Why did you do it?!<br/>
Carrie: I did _not_ turn them on.<br/>
Phineas: Well if you didn't, then who did. _Someone_ did!<br/>
Ezra: I did.<br/>
Phineas: WHY DID YOU DO THAT?! TO DRIVE ME _CRAZY_??<br/>
Ezra (giggling): Yeah! Why else would I do it?
