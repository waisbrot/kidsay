_Phineas, watching_ The Return of the King:

"He has to serve him _forever_." 

"Well. Until he dies. That's what 'service for life means'."

"You can't serve someone who's dead."

"What if you _did_ have to serve someone who was dead! How would you even do it?"

"Well, I guess that's what they call 'being alive'. Because they wouldn't be able to give you any orders."

"Because they'd be dead."
