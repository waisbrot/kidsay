The kids are playing some kind of RPG that Ezra is making up. (I can tell it's an RPG because
there is a lot more discussion of the rules than there is actual playing.)

Ezra: "OK, now you have to choose if you want to fight this guy."<br/>
Phineas: "Yeah, I do. Wait, what's his name again?"<br/>
Ezra: "Umm. I forget. It doesn't matter anyway: you defeat him!"<br/>


(Example of rules: "Because he's made of fire, if a character attacks down while he's already
attacked then it makes a spike of fire. No, not the cow -- *no* it has to be a _player_. No,
you have to attack _down_ or it doesn't work. Why are you setting your _cow_ on fire? Oh,
come back here. Zzzzzzzzzt! You're supposed to be paying attention. Come on, you're not even
on the playing board!")
