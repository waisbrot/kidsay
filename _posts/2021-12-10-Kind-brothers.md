Sometimes they can be crabby in the morning. But this morning when Phineas went to make himself more toast, Ezra asked for a piece
and Phineas made, buttered, and served it to Ezra. Later, when Phineas was struggling to put a new mask on his lanyard, Ezra said,
"I can do it for you," and fixed it for Phineas.
