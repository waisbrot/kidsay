Nate: "Ezra, pick out a book for bedtime. It's getting dark, so we need to hurry up or we'll have trouble seeing the book."

Ezra: "Well, if we found the flashlight, then we would be able to see! Let's look for the flashlight!"

Nate: "No. I don't want to look for the flashlight in the dark. We'll read by the light that we have."

Ezra: "But there isn't a lot of light."

Nate: "That's OK."

Ezra: "Well, I guess we will just have <em>trouble.</em>" (Said in this nasal-y voice that he uses when he's disagreeing but thinks we'll ignore his objections.)
