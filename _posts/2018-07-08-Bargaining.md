Ezra is eating raisins on the beach, but doesn't want to touch them himself. I feed him a couple and then tell him he's on his own.

Ezra: "Phineas, will you feed me?"<br/>
Phineas: "No."<br/>
Ezra: "I'll give you a dollar to feed me."<br/>
Phineas: "No."<br/>
Ezra: "Two dollars?"<br/>
Phineas: "No."<br/>
Ezra: "Three dollars? Four dollars? Five dollars?"<br/>
Phineas: "I will do it only for _ten_ dollars."<br/>
Ezra: "How about eight dollars and ninety-nine cents? That's only _one penny_ away from ten dollars. Because there's _one hundred_ cents in _one_ dollar."<br/>
Phineas: "How about _ten cents_?"<br/>
Ezra: "No, that's very far from one dollar. One dollar is _one hundred_ cents?"<br/>
Phineas: "Then I want _one hundred cents_."<br/>
Ezra: "And then you will feed me?"<br/>
Phineas: "Yes."<br/>
Ezra: "Okay!"<br/>
