We are nearly to Ashfield.

Me: "Grandma and grandpa won't be there; it's just going to be us, alone in the woods. You and Phineas will have to keep us safe from bear attacks"<br/>
Ezra: "Nope. I'm going to be asleep."<br/>
Me: "OK, then I guess Phineas will have to protect us from bears by himself."<br/>
Ezra: "No; he'll be asleep too."<br/>
Me: "What are we going to do about bears then?"<br/>
Ezra: "Bears don't come when there are people there."
