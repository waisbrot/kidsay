_Related to us via the daily teacher's notes. They are studying "community helpers" and spent a day on farmers (transitioning towards learning about farming)_

Ezra asked to watch an episode of Mighty Machines, "because they really help you learn information about trucks."

Elizabeth let them watch a bit about tractors.
