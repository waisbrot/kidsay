Ezra and Phineas are playing Wii. Phineas weighs too little to register on the balance board, so his skier is just going straight down the hill.

Ezra: "Phineas and I are just <em>watching</em>. We think that this is WALL-E."

Phineas: "Uh." (Shakes his head negatively)

Ezra: "Phineas thinks that this is <em>Rescue Bots</em>."
