Me: "Would you like more milk? Peanut butter is sticky and marshmallow fluff is stickey so drinking some milk or water can help keep your mouth from sticking."<br/>
Phineas: "Did you know that your mouth can make a kind liquid? So *actually* there’s already liquid in your mouth and then if you have milk or water then it’s *too much* liquid?"<br/>
Ezra (archly): "Actually, it's called 'saliva'."
