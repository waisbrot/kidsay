Ezra: What are you doing?

Me: I'm trying to figure out if this food will fit. It requires spatial reasoning. I am not very good at spatial reasoning, but Carrie is very good at it. Do you think you're good at spatial reasoning?

E: What is it?

N: Climb up here and I'll show you.

E: (Sounding resigned) What do I have to do?

N: Do you see this leftover food?

E: Yes.

N: Do you see this glass container?

E: Yes.

N: Do you think the food will fit in the container?

E: (Definitively) No.

After I used a bigger container, I could see that he was quite correct.
