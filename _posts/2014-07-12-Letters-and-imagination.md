Ezra is playing with my belt (it's a ratchet-based thing, so it has lots of holes to thread, a spring-loaded lever, and makes clicking noises).

He makes a tight loop and then holds it up edge-on with the loop on the right side.

"Nate, I made a 'P' for Phineas. Here is the 'P'," he points to the loop.
