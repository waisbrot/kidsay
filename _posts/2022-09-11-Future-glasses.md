Ezra: I think in the future, glasses should fly on tiny rockets in front of your face.<br/>
Ezra makes rocket noises. Phineas makes much louder rocket noises.

Carrie: I wouldn't want those glasses.<br/>
Me: You could just have regular glasses. They'd be retro.<br/>
Phineas: In the future, regular glasses make sounds like an oragutan.<br/>
Ezra: No, like a _howler monkey_.<br/>
Phineas: Yeah! But they look and smell like a baboon!
