In the early morning, Ezra and Vivian go to play with toys.

Vivian: "Why is there such a _mess_ here?"<br/>
Ezra: "Maybe _rats_ were playing here last night!"<br/>
Vivian: "But the door was locked, so they couldn't get in."<br/>
Ezra: "Rats can get in lots of places. Like a hole in the wall."<br/>
Vivian: "Well, there aren't any holes in the wall."<br/>
Ezra: "Well they could come in through other openings. Like, they could jump in through a _window_."<br/>
Vivian: "Or they might have been in the house _already_."<br/>
Ezra: "Yeah! They could have come out of _grandpa's boot_ at night!"<br/>
Vivian: "Yeah!"
Ezra: "Or from out of your _nose_!"<br/>
Vivian: (after squeezing her nose) "No. I can feel that there's nothing in my nose."
