Phineas is feeling sad. Carrie hold him as he finishes crying.

Phineas: (inaudible)<br/>
Carrie: What was that?<br/>
Ezra runs through the room making engine noises, drowning out whatever Phineas is saying.
Me: "Ezra..."<br/>
Phineas starts to become enraged at Ezra<br/>
Carrie: "No, no, Phineas. Don't worry about Ezra. He's doing his own thing. Not everything is about Phineas."<br/>
Phineas (in tears): "Everything is about Ezra?"<br/>
