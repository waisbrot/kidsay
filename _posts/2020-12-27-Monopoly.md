Sally is explaining to Ezra and Phineas about Monopoly. Phineas thought the thimble was a
trash can, so she's explaining what a thimble is.

Phineas: "Well, I'm not playing as any of _these_." (Sweeping his hand dramatically over the board.) "I'm playing as... The Wither!" (Pulls out his Minecraft Wither figurine)
