Ezra and Phineas have build a very long, complex train track. Phineas is slowly driving a train around and around the track. The train derails while heading up an incline.

Phineas: "Brother, you fix the train?"

Ezra: "I'm on the way!"

Ezra carefully gets the train back on the track exactly in the same spot on the hill that it was at before.

Phineas: "Thank you, brother."

Later the train derails again.

Phineas: "Brother, you fix the train?"

Ezra fixes it.

Phineas: "Thank you, brother."

The train derails for a third time.

Phineas: "You fix, brother?"

Ezra: "Maybe you shouldn't use such a long train."

(Ezra continued to fix the train.)
