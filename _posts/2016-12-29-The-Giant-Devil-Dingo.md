Visiting my parents, Phineas has become obsessed with the book "The Giant Devil-Dingo". It is about
Eelgin, the grasshopper woman, and Gaiya, her giant dingo. She uses the dingo to hunt humans for food,
until two butcher-bird brothers kill the dingo.

He understands that none of us like reading the same book twice in a row, so as soon as one person finishes reading,
he takes the book to someone else to ask "read giant devil dingo". If nobody will read it, he cries.
