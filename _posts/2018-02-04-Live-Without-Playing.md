Ezra wakes up at 6:00 sharp and comes in to our bedroom to say "anyone who wants to get up can get up now!" I get up and follow him. He goes to the living room couch and lies down under a blanket. He lies there with his eyes wide open for 10 minutes. Then sits up:

"Hey, Nate: Today's the only day that I can lay on the couch in the morning. On all the other days, I have something that I _have_ to do. Today I only have things that I _can_ do. Like play. I could live without playing."
