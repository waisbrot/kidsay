Phineas has a part of Ezra's lego fire truck (the ladder).

Phineas: "You fix it"<br/>
Ezra: "I need the rest of the fire truck. Get the rest of it."<br/>
P: "OK, brother!" (gets the rest)<br/>
E: "This piece goes _here_" (repairs the truck)<br/>
P: "Good job!" (kisses Ezra)

(Phineas immediately broke the truck again and Ezra refused to help because "I already fixed it once just now.")
