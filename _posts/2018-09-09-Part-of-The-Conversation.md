_Carrie and I had been discussing a replacement for the kids' CD-player, which died._

Me: "So, we could get a Sonos for them. It's $200 --"<br/>
Ezra: "I WANT A SONOS!"<br/>
Me: "You are not part of this conversation yet."<br/>
Phineas: "But *I* am!"<br/>
Me: "No, you are not."<br/>
Ezra: "*Why* are we not part of this conversation?"<br/>
Me: "Because it hasn't reached the kids' phase of the discussion."<br/>
Ezra: "*When* will it reach the kids' phase of the discussion?"<br/>
Carrie: "Never, if you keep interrupting..."

_The kids return to making loud hooting noises._
