At bedtime, I tell Phineas that he is "Phineas-dragon" and narrate his flight to bed:

"Phineas-dragon flies through the air!"

"Phineas-dragon turns off the light!"

"Phineas-dragon flies over big brother!"

"Phineas-dragon comes in for a landing!"

After he lands, he stands up and spreads he arms like wings and tells me about it: "Phineas-dragon fly! Phineas-dragon land! Dragon! Fly! Land here!" He spins around excitedly.
