Phineas: "Where's it? One-two-three-four-five?"<br/>
Ezra (deadpan): "It's in this hand."<br/>
Phineas: "Yeah! You got it!"<br/>
Ezra: "The trick is to not _tell_ me which hand it's in."<br/>
Phineas: "Where's it? One-two-three-four-five?"<br/>
Ezra (deadpan): "Now it's in _this_ hand."<br/>
Phineas: "Yay! You got it!"<br/>
Ezra: "This trick is to not open your hand. That makes it too easy, Phineas."<br/>
