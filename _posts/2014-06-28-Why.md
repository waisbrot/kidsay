"Nate, I want you to cut up more german pancake for me."

"OK." I start cutting it up.

"Nate, <em>why</em> are you cutting up german pancake? <em>Why,</em> Nate? Why? Why? Why? <em>Why</em>, Nate? Nate <em>why</em> are you cutting up pancake?"

"Because you asked me to. I don't understand what you're asking."

"What is why, Nate?"
