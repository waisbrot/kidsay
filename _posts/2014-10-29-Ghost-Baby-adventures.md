(Hauling multiple bags from the kitchen to the living room)

"The ghost has so much stuff. The ghost is taking so many heavy bags because the ghost is very strong. These things are all for the picnic. Phineas can come to the picnic. Now we are driving to the picnic. The ghost and baby are driving to the picnic.

"Nate, the ghost brought eggs on this picnic. Nate, do you want these eggs? These hard-boiled eggs we brought on this picnic? I'll get hard-boiled for you, Phineas. Nate-ghost: do you you want to eat these eggs? These hard-boiled eggs? They're nice and crunchy, would you like to eat them? I have more down here if you'd like more hard-boiled eggs.

"Phineas, we need to pack up all our stuff. Nate, the ghost has to go somewhere else because the baby-ghost was not listening. I'll close up the eggs.

"Nate, I managed to get myself under the couch."
