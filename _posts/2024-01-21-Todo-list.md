Carrie made the kids a "to-do" list for the weekend.

Ezra: "_Phin_eas. Why did you add 'poop' and 'commit suicide' to my todo list?!"<br/>
Phineas: "Why do you think _I_ did it?"<br/>
Ezra: "Because... I don't think anyone else would do that."<br/>

_Carrie reprimands Phineas_

Phineas: "OK. Mom let you off on committing suicide. But you still need to poop!"
