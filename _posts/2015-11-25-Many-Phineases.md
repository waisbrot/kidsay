Ezra and I are talking about Thanksgiving.

"A lot of people will be there: Susan, and Zoe, and Simon, and Marina, and Grandma, and Grandpa, and your uncle Orion, and... Simon and Zoe's grandfather, Sid."

"Why is his name <em>Sid</em>?"

"Because that's the name his parents gave him."

"What are his <em>parents'</em> names?"

"I don't know. Sid would know, though. You could ask him."

"Why does only <em>Sid</em> know what his parents' names are?"

"Well, he might not be the <em>only</em> one. But I know that he knows his parents' names. Just like you know your parents' names, right? What are your parents' names?"

"... Carrie ... and ... Ezra"

"Not quite. Let's try again. Who is your mother?"

"Nate!"

"Hmm."

"There are two Nates in this house!"

"Really?"

"And there are four Ezras, and three Carries. And eighteen Phineases!"
