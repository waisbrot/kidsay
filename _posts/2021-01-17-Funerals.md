In minecraft, one of their pets died. Ezra and Phineas built an elaborate memorial.

Ezra: "A _funeral_ is when you _celebrate_ someone's death."

Several minutes later:

Phineas: "What's that thing? When someone dies?"<br/>
Ezra: "A funeral?"<br/>
Phineas: "Yeah. Let's go back to the funeral home."
